    These are my Notes which explain the various files in the data folder..

    WeatherDbHelper is the class that helps create the database. It requires that the tables of the database are alreay created
    in WeatherContract.
    In this case we have a weather database with tables weather and location.
    Hence firstly we create the WeatherContract class which contains two classes WeatherEntry and LocationEntry both of which
    extend BaseColumns and help create tables weather and location accordingly.

    WeatherDbHelper class uses the WeatherEntry and LocationEntry fields to make a sql statement that can be executed to create
    a weather db with tables weather and location.

    WeatherProvider is the class that is an implementation of a content provider. It uses contentResolver to return cursors.
    Cursor is nothing but a a set of rows that are the result of a query.
    WeatherProvider class has code which builds all the required queries the app requires. After that it implements and overrides
    the default content provider implementations of insert,query,update,delete and onCreate().
    It creates an instance of the WeatherDbHelper class in onCreate() which is used to return the weather db to run the queries
    and other ops on.
    WeatherProvider also creates an UriMatcher that is used in the overidden default query()method of ContentProvider class.
    The code in the app calls on the query function with an Uri. The UriMatcher matches the right uri and helps the query
    method in returning the correct cursor. The UriMatcher is also used in insert,update,delete,bulkinsert ops.
